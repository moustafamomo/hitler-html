    <h1>Hitler death :</h1>
    <p>Adolf Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945 after being hunted by Soviet troops storming Berlin. He holed up in a bunker under his headquarters in Berlin and swallowed a cyanide capsule and shot himself in the head1. Eyewitnesses who saw Hitler’s body immediately after his suicide testified that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot, which has been established to have been a shot to the temple2. The news of Hitler’s death was announced on German radio the next day, May 1st2.</p>
